# 1. What is performance?

A brief note on computer performances.

Factors that affect performances:
1. file-system
2. compilers
3. cache-memory
4. main memory
5. I/O and file transfer speeds
6. user loads
7. application mixes

## 1.1 What is benchmarking?
To compare the performance of a code, we often need to set a standard for judginh the relative performance of a code on various architectures or when compiled with different compilers or linked with different libraries. The simplicity of benchmarking ends with this definitions. There exists a number of benchmarking caveates that one should care about while benchmarking a code.

1. How to choose benchmarking objectives?
2. Appropriate choice of benchmark data
3. Appropriate choice of hardwares
4. Choosing best representative benchmarking suite
5. Identifying the souce of varying benchamarking results

## 1.2 Scaling
A few lies on scaling behaviour to be discussed here.

## 1.3 How to identify benchmarking bottlenecks?
 A few general concepts...

## 1.3 Benchmarking LAMMPS

A detail note on how to carry a benchamrk for LAMMPS is given in the official LAMMPS [website](https://lammps.sandia.gov/bench.html).

In the following episodes we'll try to elaborate on a few benchmarking concepts.
